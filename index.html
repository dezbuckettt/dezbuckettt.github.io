          <h3>Eating & Sleeping</h3>

          <p>
            Like most felines, I'm an extremely competent sleeper. But what sets me apart is that I can sleep for most
            of the day and not get tired. I eat a lot, but not all the time. I mean, I have a life outside of work.

            alt="a LaTeX editor showing the symbol omega followed by the letters DES. underneath, it says \bibliography{references}"
          />

          <h3>Web Design</h3>

          <p>One time, while trying to eat some string, I accidentally typed my name. I've been typing ever since.</p>

          <p>
            I design complex, exciting, responsive websites. They're complex because only the most annoyed humans can
            understand how they were created. They're exciting because you never know what letter is going to come
            nexrreeewwwqa. They're responsive because keyboards do stuff when you jump on them.
